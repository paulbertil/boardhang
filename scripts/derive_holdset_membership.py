Derive which hold set each grid position belongs to, by sampling the per-hold-set
overlay PNGs' alpha channel. Runs for every board we bundle a hold-set filter for.

WHY
---
Neither the bundled catalogs nor boardsesh record per-hold set membership for
MoonBoard (boardsesh only tracks set_id per hole for Kilter/Tension; it skips the
set filter for board_name == 'moonboard'). But the imported board art gives it to
us implicitly: each hold set is a transparent overlay that paints only its own
holds. So for every grid cell, the set whose overlay is opaque there owns that
hold.

This lets the app answer "which problems can I climb with only these hold sets
installed?" — a problem is climbable iff every one of its holds is owned by an
active set (see HoldSetMembership / CatalogListView).

Some sets own NO grid holds (e.g. Screw-on Feet — foot accessories placed between
the numbered positions). Those are display-only art layers; the app renders them
but excludes them from the hold-set filter (a 0-count set here signals that).

Output (per board), written to BOTH the iOS bundle and the web PWA copy:
    ios/MoonBoardLED/Resources/<name>HoldSets.json
    web/src/board/membership/<name>HoldSets.json
    { "sets": [ {"id":28,"name":"Hold Set F"}, ... ],
      "membership": { "col-row": setId, ... } }   # col 0-10, row 1=bottom
